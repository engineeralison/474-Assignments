The final project is an “Environmental Sensor Alarm System” that is designed to trigger emergency alarms in homes and buildings when a break-in, flooding, or fire occurs. This ensures that any facilities that use this alarm system are quickly notified when a threat occurs, so that all occupants can quickly evacuate to safety. Motivated by the amount of fires, break-ins, and floods that unfortunately occur in people's homes or buildings, this project addresses the issue of occupants that have been affected without a good alarm system to warn them. 


Additionally, the system uses ESP NOW peer-to-peer wireless communication protocol, where one ESP32 is dedicated to sensor monitoring and the other to displaying alerts on the LCD. With its ability to detect multiple types of hazards, the Environmental Sensor Alarm System serves as a comprehensive security solution for homes, offices, and other buildings. Its integration of multiple sensors ensures a reliable and responsive alarm system that significantly improves emergency preparedness and occupant safety.


**Learning Objectives**
The learning objects of this project are applying embedded system design principles, optimizing system performance, problem solving, and innovation. 

By integrating four different sensors with an ESP32 microcontroller, values involving sound, motion, water and temperature will be collected to determine if there is danger for an alarm to be triggered. A sound and motion sensor will be used to detect a break-in into the building. A water sensor module will be used to detect when a flood occurs if a specific water level is reached. A temperature sensor will be used to detect high temperatures to signal a fire. By implementing a user interface with an LCD display, occupants can quickly identify the nature of the emergency.
