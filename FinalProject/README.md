The final project is an “Environmental Sensor Alarm System” that is designed to trigger emergency alarms in homes and buildings when a break-in, flooding, or fire occurs. This ensures that any facilities that use this alarm system are quickly notified when a threat occurs, so that all occupants can quickly evacuate to safety. Motivated by the amount of fires, break-ins, and floods that unfortunately occur in people's homes or buildings, this project addresses the issue of occupants that have been affected without a good alarm system to warn them.
